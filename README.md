# Machine Learning (ML) for Natural Language Processing (NLP)

This repository is dedicated to learning and implementing machine learning algorithms for Natural Language Processing (NLP). The project aims to provide a step-by-step approach to data preprocessing and feature extraction from text data, facilitating the development of ML models for various NLP applications.

  Regex, or Regular Expression, is a tool for searching and manipulating text patterns. By using specific symbols, you can identify patterns like emails, phone numbers, or postal codes in text, enabling their extraction or   modification. This tool is widely used across programming languages for validation, text transformation, and data preprocessing.
  
  In Natural Language Processing (NLP), Regex plays a key role in cleaning and preparing text. For example, it can be used to remove email addresses, URLs, punctuation, or identify specific tokens within a text. Regex helps in organizing textual data and extracting specific information, like keywords or names, and is one of the foundational tools for preprocessing data in NLP models.
- [Text_Preprocessing/Tweet_Preprocessing](https://github.com/aminizahra/NLP_ML/blob/main/01_Text_Preprocessing/01_Tweet_Preprocessing.ipynb):
This notebook focuses on the essential preprocessing steps for Twitter data, including cleaning, normalization, and text standardization. It prepares raw tweet data for further analysis by handling issues like emojis, special characters, stop words, and case normalization.

- [Text_Preprocessing/Tweet_FeatureExtraction](https://github.com/aminizahra/NLP_ML/blob/main/01_Text_Preprocessing/02_Tweet_FeatureExtraction.ipynb):
This notebook covers various feature extraction techniques for processed tweet text. It includes methods such as Bag of Words, TF-IDF, and other vectorization techniques to convert text data into numerical formats suitable for machine learning models in NLP.
